# Project Ant Farm
A compilation of my experiments with self-organizing systems and emergent behavior. Current methods include a Brownian motion algorithm, a Vicsek active matter model, and a branching annihilating random walk. Also a test bed for RunTime, a framework for building real-time interactive environments inside Jupyter notebooks.
